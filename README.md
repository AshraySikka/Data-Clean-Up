# Data-Clean-Up

This Python script processes a scanned or raw string and **removes any non-alphabetic and non-space characters**, replacing them with spaces. It’s useful for cleaning OCR (optical character recognition) output or messy user input.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Accepts a string input from the user.
- Iterates through each character.
- Keeps only **alphabetic characters** and **spaces**.
- Replaces all other characters (e.g., digits, punctuation, special symbols) with a space.

## 📁 File

- `string_cleaner.py`: The main script that performs the cleaning.

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python string_cleaner.py
